# üÜî Smart ID Information Extraction System

A Computer Vision and NLP-based system for automated data extraction, face verification, and liveness detection from identity documents such as Nepali Citizenship, Passport, and Driving License.

---

##  Overview

This project automates the extraction and verification of personal information from identity documents using a pipeline of advanced image preprocessing, deep learning models, OCR engines, and NLP techniques. It supports multilingual text (Devanagari + English), verifies identity using face matching, and detects liveness using blink-based detection ‚Äî all wrapped in a user-friendly interface.
