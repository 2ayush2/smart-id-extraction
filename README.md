##  Installation

###  Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- pip or conda
- Git
- GPU (optional but recommended)

---

###  Setup Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-id-extraction.git
cd smart-id-extraction

# 2. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv          # Create venv
source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install required dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

###  Running the Application

#### Start the FastAPI Backend

```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

- Opens API at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` for Swagger UI to test endpoints

#### üîπ Start the Gradio Frontend Interface

```bash
python gradio_app.py
```

- This opens a local browser window with the Gradio interface
- You can select document type, upload an ID, and view structured results

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Place your YOLO model weights (`best.pt`) inside the `models/` directory
- Ensure OCR language packs are installed for Tesseract (if used)
- You can configure paths and options in `config.py` (if applicable)
